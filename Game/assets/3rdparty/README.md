# Game State Songs
These songs represent the vibe of each state in the game, such as if a player loses or has paused the game etc. They are pulled from the AIST Dance Video Dataset to match the theme of the dances which also happen to contain copyright free music. All of the game state songs are separate from the songs which the user learns and performs in game to avoid pre-exposure effects. Original tracknames from the dataset are matched to their corresponding state below, along with a citation to the original paper.
